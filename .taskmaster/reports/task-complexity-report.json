		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup NextJS Project with Supabase Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the NextJS and Supabase setup into logical phases: 1) NextJS project initialization with TypeScript and styling libraries, 2) Supabase local development environment setup with Docker, 3) Environment configuration and security setup, and 4) Project structure organization.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (NextJS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ShadUI, Supabase, Docker) and requires proper configuration of both frontend and backend environments. The complexity comes from ensuring all these technologies work together correctly, particularly the Supabase local development setup with Docker."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Database Schema and Migrations",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the database schema implementation into: 1) Design and documentation of the Chat and Message models with their relationships, 2) Implementation of Supabase migrations for creating tables with proper constraints and indexes, and 3) Testing and validation of the database schema.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires database design knowledge and understanding of Supabase migrations. The complexity is moderate as it involves creating two related tables with proper constraints, indexes, and foreign keys. The task also requires testing to ensure the schema works as expected."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Chat Interface Components",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the chat interface implementation into: 1) Core component architecture and state management, 2) Message display components with proper styling for different message types, 3) Message input and interaction components, and 4) Responsive design and UI polish.",
			"reasoning": "Building a chat interface involves multiple interconnected components with complex state management. The UI needs to handle different message types, user interactions, and responsive design. The complexity comes from ensuring all components work together seamlessly while maintaining good performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Supabase Edge Function for Text Generation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Edge Function implementation into: 1) Supabase Edge Function setup and configuration, 2) OpenAI API integration with the specified model, 3) Streaming response handling and formatting, and 4) Error handling, rate limiting, and deployment.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves serverless function development, third-party API integration, and handling streaming responses. The complexity is high due to the need for proper error handling, rate limiting, and ensuring the function works reliably in a serverless environment. Security considerations for API keys also add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Message Persistence with Supabase",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down message persistence into: 1) Service layer design for database operations, 2) Chat session and message CRUD operations, 3) Real-time subscription implementation for live updates, and 4) Query optimization and pagination for large chat histories.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing a complete data layer with CRUD operations, real-time subscriptions, and optimization for performance. The complexity comes from ensuring data consistency, handling real-time updates, and implementing efficient pagination for potentially large datasets."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Streaming Text Responses",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the streaming implementation into: 1) Frontend state management for handling partial responses, 2) UI components for displaying streaming text with typing indicators, and 3) Error handling and connection management for robust streaming.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing streaming responses is complex due to the need for sophisticated state management to handle partial responses and ensure smooth UI updates. The task also requires handling network interruptions gracefully and providing appropriate visual feedback, making it technically challenging."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement New Chat Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the new chat functionality into: 1) UI components and state management for chat creation, 2) Database operations for creating and managing chat sessions, and 3) User experience enhancements including confirmations and transitions.",
			"reasoning": "This task is moderately complex as it involves both UI and database operations. The main challenges are ensuring proper state management when switching between chats and providing a smooth user experience with appropriate confirmations and transitions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Supabase Edge Function for Image Generation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the image generation function into: 1) Supabase Edge Function setup for image generation, 2) OpenAI image generation API integration and parameter configuration, and 3) Image storage, retrieval, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to the text generation function, this task involves serverless function development and API integration. The complexity is slightly lower than text generation as it doesn't involve streaming, but it adds complexity in handling and storing image data properly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Image Generation Mode Toggle",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the mode toggle implementation into: 1) UI components for switching between text and image modes, 2) State management and input handling for different modes, and 3) Image preview and management components.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires modifying existing components to support a new mode and creating new components for image handling. The complexity comes from ensuring smooth transitions between modes and properly handling different types of user inputs and responses."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Finalize UI/UX and Implement Responsive Design",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the UI/UX finalization into: 1) Consistent styling and theme implementation, 2) Responsive design for different devices and screen sizes, 3) Accessibility improvements and compliance, and 4) Performance optimization and final testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves polishing the entire application UI/UX, which requires attention to detail across all components. The complexity comes from ensuring consistency, responsiveness, accessibility, and performance across different devices and use cases. It requires both technical skills and design sensibility."
