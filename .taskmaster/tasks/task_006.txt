# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Streaming Text Responses
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add functionality to display AI responses character by character as they're being generated
# Details:
1. Modify the frontend to handle streaming responses from the OpenAI API
2. Implement client-side rendering of streamed text using React
3. Add a typing indicator animation while responses are being generated
4. Handle connection interruptions gracefully
5. Implement proper state management for partial responses
6. Ensure the UI updates smoothly without flickering
7. Follow the OpenAI_StreamText.md guidelines for implementation details
8. Add visual feedback for streaming status

# Test Strategy:
Test the streaming functionality with various response lengths. Verify the UI updates smoothly as characters arrive. Test error handling by simulating connection interruptions. Ensure the typing indicator displays and disappears appropriately.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Frontend State Management for Streaming [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the state management system to handle partial responses during streaming
### Details:
1. Create a streaming response state in the chat context
2. Implement reducer functions to handle streaming text updates
3. Add state transitions for starting, updating, and completing streams
4. Create utility functions to append new chunks to existing text
5. Implement proper state cleanup after stream completion
6. Ensure state updates are optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## 2. Develop UI Components for Streaming Text Display [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create the visual components needed to display streaming text with appropriate animations
### Details:
1. Create a StreamingMessage component that renders text as it arrives
2. Implement a typing indicator animation that displays during streaming
3. Add smooth text rendering without flickering or jumping
4. Implement auto-scrolling to follow new text as it appears
5. Add visual styling for in-progress vs completed messages
6. Ensure accessibility is maintained during streaming text display

## 3. Implement Error Handling and Connection Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Add robust error handling for streaming connections and recovery mechanisms
### Details:
1. Implement connection timeout handling
2. Add retry logic for interrupted streams
3. Create user-friendly error messages for connection issues
4. Implement graceful degradation to non-streaming mode when needed
5. Add visual indicators for connection status (connected, reconnecting, failed)
6. Implement proper cleanup of stream resources when switching chats or closing the application
