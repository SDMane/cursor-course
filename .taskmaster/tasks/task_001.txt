# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup NextJS Project with Supabase Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the NextJS project with App Directory structure and configure Supabase for local development
# Details:
1. Create a new NextJS project using `npx create-next-app@latest` with TypeScript
2. Configure the App Directory structure following NextJS_AppDirectory.md guidelines
3. Install and configure TailwindCSS and ShadUI for styling
4. Set up Supabase CLI for local development (refer to Supabase_CLI_GettingStarted.md)
5. Initialize Docker for running Supabase locally
6. Configure environment variables for Supabase and OpenAI API keys
7. Create basic project structure with pages, components, and API routes

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the NextJS application runs without errors, Supabase local instance is accessible, and the basic project structure is in place. Test the connection to Supabase by performing a simple query.
