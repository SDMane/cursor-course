# Description: Create React components for the chat interface including message display and input
# Details:
1. Create a ChatContainer component to manage the overall chat interface
2. Implement MessageList component to display messages with proper styling for user vs. assistant messages
3. Create MessageInput component with text area and send button
4. Implement basic state management for chat history using React hooks
5. Add styling using TailwindCSS following the minimalist design described in the PRD
