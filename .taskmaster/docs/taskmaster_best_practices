Great question! Now that you have your tasks organized, here's how to use Task Master to know when to begin tasks and manage your workflow effectively:

## 1. Check What's Ready to Work On

Start by seeing what tasks are available to work on:

```bash
npx task-master next
```

This command will show you the **next available task** based on:
- Dependencies (tasks that must be completed first)
- Priority levels
- Current status

## 2. View Your Current Task List

To see all your tasks and their status:

```bash
npx task-master list
```

This gives you an overview of:
- Which tasks are pending
- Which are in progress
- Which are completed
- Dependencies between tasks

## 3. Get Detailed Information About a Specific Task

When you want to understand what a task involves before starting:

```bash
npx task-master show <task-id>
```

For example: `npx task-master show 1` or `npx task-master show 2.1` for subtasks.

## 4. Break Down Complex Tasks

If a task seems too big, break it down into smaller subtasks:

```bash
npx task-master expand --id=<task-id> --research
```

This will create detailed subtasks that are easier to implement.

## 5. Mark Progress as You Go

As you complete work:

```bash
# Mark a task as in progress
npx task-master set-status --id=<task-id> --status=in-progress

# Mark a task as done
npx task-master set-status --id=<task-id> --status=done
```

## Typical Daily Workflow

1. **Start your day**: `npx task-master next` to see what to work on
2. **Get details**: `npx task-master show <id>` to understand the task
3. **Start working**: Set status to "in-progress"  
4. **Log progress**: Use `npx task-master update-subtask` to record findings
5. **Complete**: Mark as "done" when finished
6. **Repeat**: Run `npx task-master next` again

## Pro Tips

- **Dependencies matter**: Tasks with dependencies won't show as "next" until prerequisites are done
- **Use research flag**: Add `--research` to commands for AI-powered insights
- **Log everything**: Use `update-subtask` to record what you learn during implementation
- **Check complexity**: Run `npx task-master analyze-complexity` if tasks seem too big
